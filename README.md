# Notifications In Android  
Notification is a message that you can display to the user outside your appâ€™s UI. Android Notifications provide short and precise information about the action that happened in your app. The notification displays the icon, title, and some amount of the content text.
## Appearances on a device
Notifications could be of various formats and designs depending upon the developer such as an icon in the status bar, a more detailed entry in the notification drawer, as a badge on the app's icon.
1. Status Bar Notification - When you issue a notification, it first appears as an icon in the status bar. It appears in the same layout as the current time, battery percentage
2. Notification drawer Notification - It appears in the drop-down menu. Users can swipe down on the status bar to open the notification drawer, where they can view more details and take action with the notification.
3. Heads-Up Notification  - Beginning with Android 5.0, notifications can briefly appear in a floating window called a heads-up notification. It appears on the overlay screen, ex: Whatsapp notification, OTP messages
4. Lock-Screen Notification - It appears on the lock screen. Beginning with Android 5.0, notifications can appear on the lock screen.
5. App icon badge -  In supported launchers on devices running Android 8.0 (API level 26) and higher, app icons indicate new notifications with a colored "badge" (also known as a "notification dot") on the corresponding app launcher icon.
